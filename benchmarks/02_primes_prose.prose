Note: Prime sieve - count primes up to 5000
Let limit be 5000.
Let count be 0.
For each n from 2 to limit do the following.
    Let is_prime be true.
    For each d from 2 to n minus 1 do the following.
        Let remainder be n modulo d.
        If remainder is 0 then do the following.
            Let is_prime be false.
        End if.
    End for.
    If is_prime is true then do the following.
        Let count be count plus 1.
    End if.
End for.
Say count.
